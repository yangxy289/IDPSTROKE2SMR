The Supplementary_Tables.xlsx serves as online material for the Two-sample Mendelian randomization of brain imaging-derived phenotypes (IDP) and stroke study. Sheet 1 outlines the structure of the six main tables, while Sheet 2 provides details on the data sources used in this study. Sheets 3 and 4 present the key information on the selected instrumental variables (IVs) for IDP and stroke. Sheets 5 and 6 display the Mendelian randomization results for IDP to stroke and stroke to IDP in the European population. Sheet 7 includes a comparison between BMC's work and our study.
